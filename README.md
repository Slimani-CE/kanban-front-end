# üöÄ Kanban Task Management Application : Front-End Module

![Design](screenshots/design.webp)
## Overview
This project comprises the frontend part of a Kanban Task Management Application developed using React. It offers an interface for efficient task management via a Kanban board layout which is responsive and works on all screen sizes. My goal was to explore the app Figma design and implement it using React Framework + Build a stable and scalable backend with Java Spring Boot.
